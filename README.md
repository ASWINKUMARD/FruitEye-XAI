# FruitEye-XAI
FruitEye XAI classifies fruit as fresh or rotten using a MobileNetV2 deep learning model. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction. Explainability is implemented using Grad-CAM to visualize decision focus areas. The system provides accurate and interpretable results for real-time fruit quality assessment.
